After working my way through all thirty papers from my [list]({% post_url 2021-07-04-candidacy-overview %}){:target="_blank"}, I finally took (and passed) my candidacy exam yesterday! I suppose this means that I can finally call myself a PhD candidate, rather than a PhD student.

Anyways, [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/files/candidacy-slides.pdf %}){:target="_blank"} are the slides I made for the presentation. At the end, there are thirty appendix slides, each of which gives a one-slide summary of a paper from the list.

I'm planning on continuing to blog from here, but not in such a structured fashion as I did with my OPML series.
I'm considering having some kind of weekly newsletter that gives quick recaps of papers I've read and things I find interesting, along with periodic longer posts about particularly neat papers, my own work, or personal stuff.
Thanks for reading, and stay tuned!
