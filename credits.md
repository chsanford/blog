I'm a theory dork, which means I don't know much about web development. The following all helped me tremendously with setting the website up:
* The site was built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}, which is great for websites like this with static content.
* The comments system is built with [Staticman](https://staticman.net/){:target="_blank"}, a great open-source service. I host the Staticman code on a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/){:target="_blank"} app. I struggled a bit to set it up, so [these](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/static-comments/){:target="_blank"} [tutorials](https://spinningnumbers.org/a/staticman-heroku.html){:target="_blank"} were helpful, both for their instructions and for some code I borrowed ~~stole~~.
